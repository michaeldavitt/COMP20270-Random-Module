# Python Random Module (reduced functionality)

## Introduction
The real Python random module has many features to provide randomness to users. This version of the random module has reduced functionality. Using the MyRandom class, a user can generate a random number between 0 and 1 and a random integer in a specified range. They can also randomly sort a list and select a random element from a list. The MyDie and MyCoin classes inherit from the MyRandom class. The MyDie class is used to simulate a dice throw, and the MyCoin class is used to simulate a coin toss
